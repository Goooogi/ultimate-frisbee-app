// UFA → fantasy stat-line adapter.

// Maps a `ufa_game_player_stats` DB row into the league-agnostic
// FantasyStatLine the scoring engine consumes. This is the ONE place the
// UFA-specific derivations live:
//   • turnovers  = throwaways + drops + stalls  (no single upstream field)
//   • yards      = yards_thrown + yards_received
//
// Future leagues (WUL/PUL) get their own adapter with the same output shape.
