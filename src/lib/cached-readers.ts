// Server-only caching layer over the public league readers.
//
// The pages that consume these (/scores, /players, home standings) read
// `searchParams`, which forces per-request dynamic rendering — so their
// route-level `revalidate` exports never take effect and every request would
// otherwise hit Supabase. All of this data is public (world-readable RLS, anon
// client), so we can safely memoize it across requests with `unstable_cache`,
// keyed by the reader's own arguments and refreshed every 5 minutes.
//
// This lives in its own `server-only` module on purpose: the raw data modules
// (e.g. usau/data.ts) are intentionally importable from client components
// (live player search, mega-menu). `next/cache` is server-only, so keeping the
// cache wrappers out of those modules avoids pulling server APIs into the
// client bundle. Client components keep importing the raw readers directly.
