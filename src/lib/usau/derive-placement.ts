// Derive each team's FINAL PLACEMENT at a USAU event from its bracket results.
//
// USAU never stores a team's finish directly (usau_event_teams.final_placement
// is unpopulated). It runs a ladder of brackets whose NAME encodes the place it
// awards ("Championship" → 1st, "5th Place" → 5th, "13th Place" → 13th) and whose
// GAMES (final/semi) order teams within that place range. This module turns that
// into a { teamId → place } map, per (event, gender_division).
//
// Rules (from recon over 1,330 CLUB events — see #18; fixed 2026-09-23):
//   • Partition by gender_division — one bracket_name spans every division at an
//     event (three "Championship Bracket" finals = three divisions' champions) —
//     and by masters group prefix ("GM Women · 1st Place").
//   • bracket_name is the AUTHORITY for which place; `round` only orders games
//     within a sub-bracket (and is unreliable — pool/bracket games alike sit in
//     round='other'). So: base place from the name, position from the games.
//     Only real place tokens count: ordinals, number ranges, "13 Place". Bare
//     indexes ("Round 1", "Seeding 2", "Games to 13") are not places.
//   • A place-N bracket's decider (its 'final', else the game between its two
//     semi winners, else its single game, else the one ladder game after its
//     single semi, else the game the place-(N-1) loser plays in it — a
//     game-to-go): winner → N, loser → N+1. A single semi's loser → N+2.
//   • A bracket SECTION whose stored shape checks out against USAU's own links
//     (HTML scrapes since 2026-09-13: column 0 holds one game that feeds
//     nothing, every other game's winner feeds a game in the column before it)
//     is read by position instead: its column-0 game is the decider (no score
//     → no decider) and the column-1 games that fed it are its semis — only
//     when every one is scored, or final with its winner standing in the
//     decider (USAU advanced it). Unverified sections keep the labels.
//   • A second-chance section named without a place ("Game-To-Go Bracket",
//     "Backdoor") awards the one place its column headings name ("2nd - R5",
//     "Third Semis"), unless another bracket holds or lands on that place.
//   • Semifinal losers in a place-N bracket → N+2. If a 3rd-place-style game
//     between them exists (present only ~69% of the time), its winner → N+2,
//     loser → N+3. A rematch in any other bracket AFTER the semis orders them
//     the same way (one in a bracket that starts past N+2 leaves them
//     unplaced); with no rematch both tie at N+2.
//   • A team finishes where the LAST (lowest-ranked) placement bracket it
//     played in put it: a game-to-go / backdoor bracket decides after the one
//     that first placed it, so a final loser who then loses the 2nd-place game
//     is 3rd, not 2nd. If that bracket can't place it, it stays unplaced. A
//     bracket at N+1 that the place-N loser never plays in awards N+2 onward.
//   • EXCLUDE non-placement brackets (Play-In, Qualification) — they decide
//     next-season seeding / Worlds qualification, not this event's finish. A
//     numbered game-to-go ("2nd Place Game to Go") awards its place.
//   • Only status='final' games are results; a cancelled one only fills out
//     its section's shape.
//
// Deliberately conservative: when the data can't place a team unambiguously we
// leave it UNPLACED rather than guess — a wrong placement is worse than none.
//
