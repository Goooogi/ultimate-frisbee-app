// The Layout — home page, restructured to the "Home v2" design spec.
// Server component: fetches today's slate + current standings + team-stats in
// parallel and hands shaped data to the home components.
//
// Page order (desktop, per HomeV2 in the design source, restructured so all
// standings live together at the top):
//   1. Nav (AppRail — untouched)
//   2. Full-width hero carousel (UFA → USAU → WFDF → PUL → WUL)
//   3. "Every league, one place." strip
//   4. "Up next" — UFA + USAU cards, side by side on desktop (a lone card
//      spans the row with two inner columns)
//   5. LEAGUE STANDINGS group — "Top of the league" (4 UFA division cards),
//      "Recent results" (one card per IN-SEASON league, swipe row on mobile),
//      USAU Rankings (full-width 4×4 grid of the top 16), then the "Season
//      complete" carousel
//   6. Footer
//
// Which leagues appear where is decided by src/lib/home/season-phase.ts: a
// league is `in-season` (Recent results), `complete` (Season complete, for six
// months after its final) or `dormant` (neither). Every section wrapper is
// gated on content, so an empty section is absent — never a blank band — and
// the row primitives (StandingsCarousel / UpNextCards) rebalance to whatever
// count is left. Any league with no current content is simply omitted.
