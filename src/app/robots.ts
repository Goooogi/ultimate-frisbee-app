// Crawler hygiene (see vault: Supabase Load Diagnosis 2026-08-11). The by-name
// player routes exist to resolve roster names → canonical /players/[id] pages;
// to a crawler they are thousands of long-tail duplicate URLs whose FIRST hit
// always misses the ISR cache and runs a name-resolution RPC (measured at
// 190/min of find_usau_player_by_name). Canonical content lives on /players —
// keep crawlers off the resolvers. /admin and /api are not crawlable content.
// Allowlist-only (2026-08-12): default-deny every crawler, allow only the two
// major well-behaved ones. Middleware enforces the same policy with 403s for
// bots that ignore robots.txt.
